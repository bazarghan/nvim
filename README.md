# My Personal Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim setup, configured to work like a modern IDE with a focus on Python and web development. It's built with Lua and managed by `lazy.nvim`.

The goal is a fast, keyboard-centric environment that I can quickly deploy on any new machine (macOS or Linux).

### Quick Setup

This setup requires `git` to be installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bazarghan/nvim.git](https://github.com/bazarghan/nvim.git) ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2.  **Run the installer:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.config/nvim/install.sh
    ~/.config/nvim/install.sh
    ```

The script handles all dependencies (Neovim, Node.js, Ripgrep, etc.) and installs the plugins.
